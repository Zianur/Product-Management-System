## Introduction

The **Product Management System** is a full-stack web application developed using **React** and **Spring Boot**. It enables users to manage products, allowing them to upload product details, view products, edit existing products, and delete products from the system.

This documentation explains the structure of the project, setup, API details, and how to contribute to it.

## Architecture

The system is divided into two main components:

- **Frontend (React):** The user interface allows users to interact with the application.
- **Backend (Spring Boot):** Manages data and provides RESTful API endpoints to handle product operations.

The following diagram outlines the general architecture of the project:

```
+--------------------+        +--------------------+
|                    |        |                    |
|     Frontend       | <----> |     Backend        |
|      (React)       |        |   (Spring Boot)    |
|                    |        |                    |
+--------------------+        +--------------------+
```

- The frontend communicates with the backend via RESTful API calls.
- The backend uses **MySQL** for storing product data and **Spring Data JPA** for data persistence.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (version 14.x or higher)
- **Java** (version 11 or higher)
- **MySQL** (version 8.x or higher)
- **Maven** (version 3.x or higher)

## Installation

### Backend Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/product-management-system.git
   cd product-management-system/backend
   ```

2. Configure MySQL database in `src/main/resources/application.properties`:

   ```properties
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_database
   spring.datasource.username=your_username
   spring.datasource.password=your_password
   ```

3. Install dependencies and run the Spring Boot application:
   ```bash
   mvn install
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

4. The backend will run on `http://localhost:8080`.

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   ```

2. Install the required npm dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the React app:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. The frontend will run on `http://localhost:3000`.

## API Endpoints

Here are the API endpoints provided by the backend:

| Method | Endpoint            | Description              | Example Request           |
|--------|---------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| GET    | `/api/products`      | Fetch all products       | `curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/products` |
| POST   | `/api/products`      | Add a new product        | `curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name":"Product", "description":"A great product", "price":100}' http://localhost:8080/api/products` |
| PUT    | `/api/products/{id}` | Update an existing product | `curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name":"Updated Product", "price":120}' http://localhost:8080/api/products/1` |
| DELETE | `/api/products/{id}` | Delete a product         | `curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/api/products/1` |

### Example API Request

To add a product via API, you can use the following example:

```json
POST /api/products
{
  "name": "Sample Product",
  "description": "This is a sample product.",
  "price": 25.99
}
```

## Usage

Once both the frontend and backend are running, you can:

1. **View Products:** Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see the list of products.
2. **Add a Product:** Use the "Add Product" button to upload a new product with relevant details.
3. **Edit a Product:** Click the "Edit" button on any product to modify its details.
4. **Delete a Product:** Use the "Delete" button to remove a product from the list.

## Screenshots

| Feature              | Screenshot |
|----------------------|------------|
| **Product List View** | ![Product List](screenshots/product-list.png) |
| **Add Product**       | ![Add Product](screenshots/add-product.png) |
| **Edit Product**      | ![Edit Product](screenshots/edit-product.png) |
| **Delete Product**    | ![Delete Product](screenshots/delete-product.png) |

Add your screenshots to the `screenshots/` directory and link them here.

## Troubleshooting

- **Database Connection Error:** Make sure MySQL is running, and you've correctly configured your database credentials in the `application.properties` file.
- **CORS Errors:** If you encounter CORS errors while making API requests, you may need to configure CORS in your Spring Boot application by adding appropriate CORS mappings in a configuration class.
- **React App Not Loading:** Ensure the frontend is correctly pointing to the backend API. Check if the API base URL is properly configured.

## Contributing

If you'd like to contribute:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/new-feature`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add new feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/new-feature`).
5. Open a pull request.
